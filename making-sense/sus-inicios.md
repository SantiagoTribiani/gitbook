# The Beginnings

Going Further, Right From the Start

César’s idea for a new kind of company started taking shape early on. From his work experience in the USA, the idea of starting a company that offered a development service different from those he had worked with, began to take shape.

His training in systems and his passion for design shaped Cesar's desire not only to deliver development solutions but to go even further. In Cesar’s world, design and "User Experience" are elevated to become actual differentiators of the product.

Damián and Cesar started wondering, why not take their passion and transfer it into developing products for other companies.

With this premise, in 2006, he and Damián, his Argentina-based brother, founded "Common Sense" \(the original name of Making Sense\). Their main objective was to provide innovative software products.

Cesar started looking for customers outside of Argentina, to whom they offered not just development but also UX. They would take each step and write each line of code with the user in mind.

Little by little, more people joined their group. It what was no longer just an idea on the verge of becoming something. It was real and it was happening. Together with Nacho, Sergio and Juan, they opened their first office \(an office that they painted themselves, btw!\).

Soon, brands like Del, AMD and Microsoft came to regard the services of Making Sense.

 After much effort, they managed to launch their first product and Doppler was born. Today, it’s considered to be one of the most predominant email marketing tool in Latin America.

But Doppler was the trigger for something more. Their experience with Doppler motivated them and they went for more. 4 years after that milestone, Lander was launched. Lander is a web application for the creation of Landing Pages and is a product which, after years of development and growth in the USA, was sold to a Silicon Valley company.

Today at Making Sense, we work side-by-side with our clients toward the conception of new projects or the modernization of applications that they are already using. User Experience \(UX\) figures heavily in every decision and with every step we take. We put the user front-and-center, which is what distinguishes our company. We offer our clients services based on web solutions, application integration, migration, maintenance and support.

With pride, we can tell you that today we are more than 200 professionals working in offices located in Palo Alto, California in the United States, Mar del Plata, Tandil, Córdoba and Buenos Aires in Argentina and Mexico City.

We are members of the Chamber of Software Companies & Services of Argentina \(CESSI\) and its representatives in the United States through the ArgenTInaIT network, an internalization platform whose objective is to facilitate the insertion and consolidation of Argentine software companies and computer services in the most attractive global markets. Also we are members of ATICMA, an association engaged in grouping ICT freelancers, entrepreneurs, businesses and universities in Mar del Plata and surroundings to work together.
