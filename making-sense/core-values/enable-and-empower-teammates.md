# Enable and empower teammates

We are not superheroes, we need our team to support us. Trust them, help them, work together. Donâ€™t leave teammates behind, enable them by lending a hand to help them accomplish things they could not do by themselves. And help them learn so they empower themselves by acquiring the means to take more control and become stronger and more independent.
