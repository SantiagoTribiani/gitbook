# Be accountable for and proud of what you do

We should “own” our assignments and feel responsible for our results. When we are personally accountable, we stop assigning blame, “should-ing” on people, and making excuses. Instead, we take the fall when our choices cause problems.

And at the end of each day we want to feel proud of what we achieved, knowing that we have done our best dealing with both, things that we can control, and things that we cannot.
