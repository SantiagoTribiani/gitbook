# Build relationships based on empathy and open/honest communication

Honesty and openness help build trust and compatibility. When we and our clients openly reveal the facts of our past, our present activities, and our plans for the future, we are able to make intelligent decisions that take each other's needs into account, thus creating a win-win situation.
