# Doppler

As a Software Development company, we help organizations creating products from scratch or modernizing current applications, but we also develop our own products, since the inception of the idea and until the launch.

The fact that we've developed our own products \(Doppler and Lander\) let us know what it takes to build an app from scratch and make it successful; and in this way, we can provide the best advice for our partners, since we've been in their shoes.

We have two milestones in our history that were the development of our own products: Doppler in 2006, and Lander in 2012.

Launched to the market in 2006, Doppler has become through the years one of the most important Email Marketing tools in Latin America. Based in Mar del Plata, Doppler has more than 50 employees distributed in Latin Am√©rica and Spain, making happy 130.000 users who sent more than 310.000.000 emails per month!

Doppler's structure is formed by six departments - Marketing, Design, Development, Support, Sales and Administration, all aligned to provide the best user experience and the tools to achieve their business goals.
