As a Software Development company we help organizations creating products from scratch or modernizing current applications, but we also develop our own products, since the inception of the idea and until the launch.

Based in Mar del Plata, Doppler has more than 50 employees distributed in Latin América and Spain, making happy 130.000 users who sent more than 310.000.000 emails per month!

Doppler's structure is formed by six departments - Marketing, Design, Development, Support, Sales and Administration, all aligned to provide the best user experience and the tools to achieve their business goals.
