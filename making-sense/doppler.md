As a Software Development company, we help organizations creating products from scratch or modernizing current applications, but we also develop our own products, since the inception of the idea and until the launch. We provide a great work environment, where you can feel free to create and innovate, in this way we have developed **Doppler**.

Launched to the market in 2006, it has become through the years one of the **most important Email Marketing tools in Latin America**. Based in Mar del Plata, Doppler has more than 50 employees distributed in Latin América and Spain, making happy 130.000 users who sent more than 310.000.000 emails per month!

Doppler's structure is formed by six departments - Marketing, Design, Development, Support, Sales and Administration, all aligned to provide the best user experience and the tools to achieve their business goals.

Currently, users can send custom Email Marketing campaigns and get reports that they can use to optimize their marketing actions.
