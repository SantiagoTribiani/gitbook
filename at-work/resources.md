# Resources

There is not only one right way to work but here in Making Sense we have one, based in transparent relationships that we build day by day through highly efficient collaborative work methods. We believe in the value of communication and how much we can build through it. 

Below you will find our most used daily work tools.:

We use Slack for instant messaging, Zoom for online meetings, Google Drive to share our work with others and collaborate.  


Jira for IT, HR \(licencias\) and Financial requests. 

Confluence to learn more about our departments.

 We use Google Calendar to coordinate or schedule a meeting. There you'll find the calendars of the other team members so you can check their availability, as well as the available resources that we have in the office.

 We have full equipped meeting rooms, with TV, where you can have either virtual conferences or face to face meetings.
