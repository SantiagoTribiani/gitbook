We use **Google Calendar** to coordinate or schedule a meeting. There you'll find the calendars of the other team members so you can check their availability, as well as the available resources that we have in the office.

We have full equipped **meeting rooms**, with TV, where you can have either virtual conferences or face to face meetings.
