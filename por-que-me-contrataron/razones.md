## Pondri√≠a un titulo aca "Why you and no one else"

This is your first day at **Making Sense** and it's not a coincidence. If you're here with us, is because we consider that we share values and principles, and this is vital for us. Secondly, you are with us because we consider you' re good at what you do and you are able to do things. And this is so important, because we are a group of people who do things. Not only think, recommend and shape, also we put our hands-on to work. Don't forget to be yourself, be authentic, bring your best every morning, talk when you disagree, propose ideas, try to improve, help others, do, relax and have fun.
