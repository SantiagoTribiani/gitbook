# Reasons and expectations

Be in your first day at Making Sense is not a coincidence. If you're here with us, is because we considered that we share values and principles, and this is vital for us. When we share values, the rest are details. In a second instance, we hired you because considered you're smart and you are able to do things. And this is so important, cause we are a group of people who do things. Not only think, recommend and shape, also we puts our hands-on to work. 

Be yourself, be authentic, bring with you your best every morning, talk when you're disagree, popouse ideas, try to improve, help others, do, relax and have fun.
