# Benefits

## Lunch 

We offer 5 different options per day for lunch. Also we have coffee, cereals, cookies and fruit available during all the day.

## Active Pause 

We all know about unhealthy habits that plague the work day. Therefore, here at Making Sense once a week we stop our activities to do postural exercises, stretching and walk along the park or beach.

## English Lessons 

We trust in the power of communication and how we can build good relationships through it. Have a good command of English allows you to have a better performance at your work, but also as we know it's a very important tool for you and for your own professional growth.
