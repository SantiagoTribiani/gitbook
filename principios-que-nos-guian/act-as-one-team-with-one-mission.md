# Act as one team with one mission

We want our entire organization and team members to be aligned with our mission, vision and values. “One team” members collaborate and learn together, share wins and losses. “Individual commitment to a group effort – that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.” \(Quote from Vince Lombardi, coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s\)
